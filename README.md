# Contact List App

A simple .NET application for managing contacts, built as part of my C# course within my .NET Web Developer education at EC Utbildning Helsingborg 2024-2026. This app allows users to store, view, and manage their contacts.

## Features
Anything marked with a + has been implemented
### For "Godk채nt" (Passing Grade)

    + Whenever the contact list is updated.
  + **Applies the "S" principle from SOLID** in code structure.
  + **Unit tests** (without mock) for methods that can be tested without mocking.
